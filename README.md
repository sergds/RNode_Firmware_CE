# Raspberry Pi RP MCU port
Experimental port for pico chip family based on my personal branch with adapted LR1121 driver by Ben Agricola + subjective changes.

Compatible RNodeInterface and rnodeconf are available [HERE](https://forge.sergds.xyz/sergds/Reticulum/src/branch/rp2xxx)

## Implemented boards:
### BOARD_GENERIC_RP2XXX (Generic RP2XXX Board)
A generic Pico2-based build. 1 radio interface, LR1121 modem. i2c1 is dedicated to OLED.

LoRA module is Waveshare Core1121-HF.

### Pinout:

| Pin                        | GPIO Number |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| SDA_OLED                   | 18          |
| SCL_OLED                   | 19          |
| PIN_WAKEUP + pin_btn_usr1  | 12          |
| pin_led_rx + pin_led_tx    | 25          |
| LR1121 Slave Select (SS)   | 5           |
| LR1121 Serial Clock (SCLK) | 2           |
| LR1121 Master Out (MOSI)   | 3           |
| LR1121 Master In (MISO)    | 4           |
| LR1121 DIO0 (BUSY)         | 15          |
| LR1121 DIO1 (IRQ)          | 16          |
| LR1121 NRESET              | 6           |

### Build and flash:

```shell
make firmware-pico2
make upload-pico2
```

> Pro tip:
> you can specify rnodeconf to execute in make like this:
> 
> `make upload-pico2 RNODECONFEXE="python ~/Reticulum/RNS/Utilities/rnodeconf.py"`

Provision EEPROM:
```shell
python rnodeconf.py /dev/ttyACM0 -r --platform 60 --product 65 --model fc --hwrev 01
```

Set firmware hash by reflashing via make or:
```shell
python rnodeconf.py /dev/ttyACM0 -H $(sha256sum build/rp2040.rp2040.rpipico2/RNode_Firmware_CE.ino.bin | cut -d " " -f1) # Or manually provide a sha256 hash of a .bin file after -H
```

## Current RP-specific differences from upstream:
- Device ID is pico unique ID (OTP CHIPID on RP235X, Flash UID on RP2040) instead of bluetooth MAC + sig hash.
- 10 Second button push resets device into usb boot (BOOTSEL) mode instead of weird esp-specific console thingy.

## Current chip support:
### RP235X: Both ARM and RISC-V modes work, tested
- [X] Boots up, radio interface works
- [X] Display, input
- [X] Sleep mode (implemented via DORMANT mode)
- [X] Device validation (firmware validation via hashing)
- [ ] Bluetooth (Pico W, Boards with RM2)

### RP2040: Works, tested. Validation is slower because no crypto hw and no dsp instructions
- [X] Boots up, radio interface works
- [X] Display, input
- [X] Sleep mode (implemented via DORMANT mode)
- [X] Device validation (firmware validation via hashing) (A bit slower, though)
- [ ] Bluetooth (Pico W, Boards with RM2)

# RNode Firmware - Community Edition

This is the community maintained fork of the open firmware which powers RNode devices. It has been created to continue to expand development and support for more hardware devices, as the upstream repository is no longer accepting PRs for new hardware support. The original repository by Mark Qvist can be found [here](https://github.com/markqvist/RNode_Firmware).

An RNode is an open, free and unrestricted digital radio transceiver. It enables anyone to send and receive any kind of data over both short and very long distances. RNodes can be used with many different kinds of programs and systems, but they are especially well suited for use with [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network).

RNode is not a product, and not any *one* specific device in particular. It is a system that is easy to replicate across space and time, that produces highly functional communications tools, which respects user autonomy and empowers individuals and communities to protect their sovereignty, privacy and ability to communicate and exchange data and ideas freely.

<img src="Documentation/images/rnv21_bgp.webp" width="100%">

<center><i>An RNode made from readily available and cheap parts, in a durable 3D printed case</i></center><br/><br/>

The RNode system is primarily software, which *transforms* different kinds of available hardware devices into functional, physical RNodes, which can then be used to solve a wide range of communications tasks. Such RNodes can be modified and built to suit the specific time, locale and environment they need to exist in.

## Latest Release

The latest release, installable through `rnodeconf`, is version `1.75`. This release brings the following changes:

- Set correct flash size for Xiao esp32s3 by @easytarget in #72
- Add NeoPixel support for LILYGO LoRa32 by @0x62 in #71
- Fixed a bug causing infinite reception detection, making the RNode unusable
- Updated WisBlock SX1280 module PA curve
- Fixed builds for the LilyGO T-Echo
- Incorporated changes from upstream v1.82

You must have at least version `2.1.3` of `rnodeconf` installed to update your RNode Firmware install to version `1.75`. **YOU MUST USE AN RNS VERSION HIGHER THAN `0.9.3` IF YOU ARE USING A MULTI-INTERFACE RNODE!**

## Supported Transceiver Modules
The RNode Firmware supports all transceiver modules based on the following chips:
* Semtech SX1262
* Semtech SX1276
* Semtech SX1278
* Semtech SX1280

These also must have an **SPI interface** and **DIO_0 (sometimes called DIO_1)** pin connected to the MCU directly.

## One Tool, Many Uses

The RNode design is meant to flexible and hackable. At it's core, it is a low-power, but extremely long-range digital radio transceiver. Coupled with Reticulum, it provides encrypted and secure communications.

Depending on configuration, it can be used for local networking purposes, or to send data over very long distances. Once you have an RNode, there is a wide variety of possible uses:

- As a network adapter for [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network)
- Messaging using [Sideband](https://unsigned.io/software/Sideband.html)
- Information sharing and communication using [Nomad Network](https://unsigned.io/software/Nomad_Network.html)
- LoRa-based [KISS-compatible amateur radio TNC](https://unsigned.io/guides/2020_05_03_using_rnodes_with_amateur_radio_software.html)
- LoRa development platform
- [Packet sniffer](https://unsigned.io/software/LoRaMon.html) for LoRa networks
- Long range [Ethernet and IP network interface](https://unsigned.io/guides/2020_05_27_ethernet-and-ip-over-packet-radio-tncs.html) on Linux
- As a general-purpose long-range data radio

## Types & Performance

RNodes can be made in many different configurations, and can use many different radio bands, but they will generally operate in the **433 MHz**, **868 MHz**, **915 MHZ** and **2.4 GHz** bands. They will usually offer configurable on-air data speeds between just a **few hundred bits per second**, up to **hundreds of kilobits per second**. Maximum output power will depend on the transceiver and PA setup used, but will generally lie between **17 dbm (50mW)** and **27 dBm (500mW)**.

The RNode system has been designed to allow reliable systems for basic human communications, over very wide areas, while using very little power, being cheap to build, free to operate, and near impossible to censor.

While **speeds are lower** than WiFi, typical communication **ranges are many times higher**. Several kilometers can be acheived with usable bitrates, even in urban areas, and over **100 kilometers** can be achieved in line-of-sight conditions.

## A Self-Replicating System

If you notice the presence of a circularity in the naming of the system as a whole, and the physical devices, it is no coincidence. Every RNode contains the seeds necessary to reproduce the system, the [RNode Bootstrap Console](https://unsigned.io/rnode_bootstrap_console), which is hosted locally on every RNode, and can be activated and accesses at any time - no Internet required.

The designs, guides and software stored within allows users to create more RNodes, and even to bootstrap entire communications networks, completely independently of existing infrastructure, or in situations where infrastructure has become unreliable or is broken.

<img src="Documentation/images/126dcfe92fb7.webp" width="100%"/>

<center><i>Where there is no Internet, RNodes will still communicate</i></center><br/><br/>

The production of one particular RNode device is not an end, but the potential starting point of a new branch of devices on the tree of the RNode system as a whole.

This tree fits into the larger biome of Free & Open Communications Systems, which I hope that you - by using communications tools like RNode - will help grow and prosper.

## Getting Started Fast
You can download and flash the firmware to all the supported boards using [rnodeconf](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum). All firmware releases are handled and installed directly through the `rnodeconf` utility, which is included in the `rns` package. It can be installed via `pip`:

```
# Install rnodeconf via rns package
pip install rns --upgrade

# Install the firmware on a board with the install guide
rnodeconf --autoinstall
```

For most of the supported device types, it is also possible to use [Liam Cottle's Web-based RNode Flasher](https://liamcottle.github.io/rnode-flasher/). This option may be easier if you're not familiar with using a command line interface.

For more detailed instruction and in-depth guides, you can have a look at some of these resources:

- Create a [basic RNode from readily available development boards](https://unsigned.io/guides/2022_01_25_installing-rnode-firmware-on-supported-devices.html)
- Follow a complete build recipe for [making a handheld RNode](https://unsigned.io/guides/2023_01_14_Making_A_Handheld_RNode.html), like the one pictured above
- Learn the basics on how to [create and build your own RNode designs](https://unsigned.io/guides/2022_01_26_how-to-make-your-own-rnodes.html) from scratch
- Once you've got the hang of it, start building RNodes for your community, or [even for selling them](https://unsigned.io/sell_rnodes.html)

## Support development
### Contributing
You can contribute features and board support to the project if you wish. Please see [here](Documentation/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Hardware donations
If you would like to see support added for a board which you possess, you may donate it to myself, Jacob Eva, so that I can implement support for it into this project. There will be no official timescale given for implementation however, but I will try my best when I have time :) Please [contact me (scroll to the bottom)](https://liberatedsystems.co.uk/about) if you wish to donate hardware to the project.

### Purchasing products
You can support the development of the RNode Firmware CE project by purchasing RNodes (to come in the future) and other products from [Liberated Embedded systems](https://liberatedsystems.co.uk), my online business. For more information on my business, please see [here](https://liberatedsystems.co.uk/about/).

From time to time the creator of the [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network) project, Mark Qvist, produces his own RNodes and sells them through his [shop](https://unsigned.io/shop). You may support the development of open, free and private communications systems through purchasing these from him.

### Monetary donations
I, the maintainer of this fork, am currently not accepting monetary donations. These are instead better directed to [Mark Qvist](https://unsigned.io), who created the original repository this one is based on, and is the core developer of the [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network) project, which is what the RNode Firmware was designed to supplement as a network adapter.
